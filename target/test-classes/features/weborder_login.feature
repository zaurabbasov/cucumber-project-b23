Feature: Web order app login
  As a user
  I should be able to login to web order app

  # This is where repeating beginning code can go , this is how we comment in feature file
  Background:
    # This is a shared step for all scenarios so e can remove duplicate
    # by putting it in Background section of feature
    Given we are at web order login page

  Scenario: User login successfully
#    Given we are at web order login page
    When we provide valid credentials
    Then we should see all order page

  Scenario: User login fail
#    Given we are at web order login page
    When we provide invalid credentials
    Then we should still be at login page
    And login error message should be present

  Scenario: User login with specific credentials
    # whatever is enclosed inside quotation " " will be send as parameter value
    # step definition will look like this
    # @When("user provide username {string} and password {string}")
    When user provide username "Tester" and password "test"
    Then we should see all order page

  Scenario: User login with wrong credentials

    When user provide username "BLA" and password "BLA"
    Then we should still be at login page
    And login error message should be present
